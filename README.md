# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose: 

PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.

We were tasked with answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? So after we defined what "ideal" really means. We narrowed our search to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for our client.

## Process :

We followed our 3 step process in doing our analysis :
- Retrieve Weather Data - Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
- Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map - We used input statements to filter the data for our clients weather preferences, which was then used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map -From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester then choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
